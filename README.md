# WindyAPI
The modified Windy API for the Forge website. This code displays the Forge Logo as well as an info icon that when hovered over shows two dropdowns with information on how to use the map. There are also markers of hikes on the map (I only included a few here) which whern clicke don display the name and image of the hike with a link attatched to the image when clicked that redirects to the page.

In addition there are a couple other features included from the Windy API tutorials, some commented out, so that the options to further modify the API are there.
